          vulnerability is in a feature we don't use (tar-fs's `extract` - we
          only use `pack`), is only a problem on a system that is already
          compromised (so anyone with this problem has bigger problems), and is
          considered inherent to the type of operation, therefore unfixable
          (https://github.com/isaacs/chownr/issues/14#issuecomment-451543037)
